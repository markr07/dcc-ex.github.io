DCC-EX Releases EX-CSB1 Ready to Run DCC CommandStation
=======================================================

DCC-EX, a global contributor to DCC open source software for model railroading, is proud to announce the second of our open source hardware products: the |EX-CSB1| CommandStation and Booster, providing dual 5 amp |DCC| and |DC PWM| (pulse width modulation) output.

The |EX-CSB1| addresses the needs of DCC-EX users who want a ready-to-run DCC and DC CommandStation that will have them running trains within 5 minutes of plugging it into power and track. 

With its built-in fast WiFi capability, up to 10 users can connect simultaneously using a phone or tablet in addition to commercially available throttles, in order to run trains and control their entire layout.

A DCC-EX Command Station can now outperform commercial DCC command stations which typically have single 3-3.5A or 5A output capabilities, and doing so at a fraction of the cost and with more advanced features.

The |EX-CSB1| is the  second offering in the DCC-EX open source hardware ecosystem specifically designed for model railroaders, and is a direct result of the strong community engagement DCC-EX strives to inspire.

Featuring an ESP32 processor with built-in fast WiFi, and dual 5A output Texas Instruments MOSFET motor drivers, the EX-CSB1 features the same proven reliable output stage as the previous EX-MotorShield8874. The DRV8874 H-Bridge ICs also include hardware overcurrent protection monitored by EX-CommandStation, in addition to the existing software-based overload protection. It has a single 2.1mm barrel jack DC power for both the DCC/DC output and to supply the ESP32.

EX-CSB1 also allows stacking of the original EX-MotorShield8874 with zero hardware modifications to provide four DCC and |DC PWM| track outputs. Now users needing more power or more power districts have a strikingly simple upgrade path.

EX-CSB1's exciting new feature is Booster mode. Using the built-in Railsync compatible DCC input jack and a small piece of EXRAIL scripting, the EX-CSB1 can switch automatically into Booster mode to produce the same DCC output on any or all of up to 4 DCC outputs. Whilst in Booster mode, the EX-CSB1 can still respond to sensor inputs and perform EXRAIL animations as a remote animation node.

EX-CSB1 sports I2C support via an industry standard STEMMA QT/Qwiic connectors and pin headers making I2C bus connections easier than ever. The STEMMA QT/Qwiic ecosystem of I2C boards from Adafruit and Sparkfun are now the easiest I2C expansion boards to use. The DCC-EX team expects to add additional STEMMA QT/Qwiic based peripherals with model railroading friendly features in upcoming releases. An I2C SIP header is included to allow many I2C enabled OLED screens to plug directly into the board.

In addition, the |EX-CSB1-SHORT| expands on the proven EXRAIL automation and animation capabilities with even more memory for larger scripts to control locos, lighting, turnouts/points, servos, and virtually everything else on the layout.

The EX-CSB1 is available immediately for purchase in the United States, the UK, Austria, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia. Pricing starts at US$120 / AU$190 / £99 / €115 the DCC-EX store and resellers listed here:

Initial documentation is at: http://dcc-ex.com/ex-csb1/index with design files on the DCC-EX: Github https://github.com/DCC-EX/EX-CSB1 |EXTERNAL-LINK|.

In connection with the release of the EX-CSB1, version 5.0 of the EX-CommandStation is releasing with extended support for the EX-CSB1 and the entire suite of DCC-EX products.

DCC-EX would like to extend special thanks to team members Paul Antoine and Harald Barth for their ideas and contribution to the funding and design of the |EX-CSB1-SHORT| and engineer (head designer of the EX-MotorShield8874), Erwin Peterlin of Semify in Austria providing his time and design expertise.
